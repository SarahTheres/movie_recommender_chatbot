# Examining User Preference for Agreeableness in Chatbots
This is the source code for the personality imbued movie recommender chatbots we developed as part of a research project at LMU Munich (Germany). This research project was published at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3469595.3469633">CUI '21</a>. More details about the project as well as an extended description of the implementation may be found on the <a href="http://www.medien.ifi.lmu.de/agreeableness-chatbots/">project website</a>.

## Abstract
Recent research suggests that deliberately manipulating a chatbot’s personality and matching it to the user’s personality can positively impact the user experience. Yet, little is known about whether this similarity attraction effect also applies to the personality dimension agreeableness. In a lab experiment, 30 participants interacted with three versions of an agreeable chatbot (agreeable, neutral, and disagreeable). Whilst our results corroborate a similarity attraction effect between user agreeableness and their preference for the agreeable chatbot, we did not find a reversed relationship with a disagreeable chatbot. Our findings point to a need for moderate instead of extreme chatbot personalities.

## Implementation
The three chatbots were implemented on <a href="https://botpress.com">Botpress</a>, version 10.47.0 in 2018/19. <a href="https://botpress.com">Botpress</a> is an open source development platform for chatbots and is written in JavaScript. To ensure predictable behaviour and a consistent expression of the predefined personalities, we developed rule-based chatbots. More details about the project as well as an extended description of the implementation may be found on the <a href="http://www.medien.ifi.lmu.de/agreeableness-chatbots">project website</a>. Please note that the current Botpress version has an updated architecture so that our source code may not simply be transferred.

Please note that the current version of the chatbot implementation was intended for internal use only. We publish our source code to make the research accessible and transparent in the spirit of Open Science. That is, the source code is not documented in such a way that it can be easily reused.
